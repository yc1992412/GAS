Matplotlib created a temporary config/cache directory at /tmp/matplotlib-5c35nuxw because the default path (/home/lidi/.config/matplotlib) is not a writable directory; it is highly recommended to set the MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable to a writable directory, in particular to speed up the import of Matplotlib and to better support multiprocessing.
Matplotlib is building the font cache; this may take a moment.
