Matplotlib created a temporary config/cache directory at /tmp/matplotlib-4wrkbam7 because the default path (/home/lidi/.config/matplotlib) is not a writable directory; it is highly recommended to set the MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable to a writable directory, in particular to speed up the import of Matplotlib and to better support multiprocessing.
Matplotlib is building the font cache; this may take a moment.
/scratch/lidi/PaperUse/Code/GAS_two/GAS.py:621: UserWarning: To copy construct from a tensor, it is recommended to use sourceTensor.clone().detach() or sourceTensor.clone().detach().requires_grad_(True), rather than torch.tensor(sourceTensor).
  plt.scatter(torch.cat((torch.tensor(xi_add_all[:,0:1]),xi_bound_add_all[:,0:1])), torch.cat((torch.tensor(xi_add_all[:,1:2]),xi_bound_add_all[:,1:2])), s=0.5)
/scratch/lidi/PaperUse/Code/GAS_two/GAS.py:394: RuntimeWarning: More than 20 figures have been opened. Figures created through the pyplot interface (`matplotlib.pyplot.figure`) are retained until explicitly closed and may consume too much memory. (To control this warning, see the rcParam `figure.max_open_warning`).
